To create a new package (let's say `MyPackage`):
- fork this package in your own or your organisation account (let's say `MyUser`)
- from the github interface:
  - edit the `README.md` file to update the badges
  - edit the `Project.toml` file to change package name, author, dependences and UUID (you can get a new UUID from a Julia prompt with `using UUIDs; uuid1()`) 
  - edit the file `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to update the package name
  - rename the file `src/MyAwesomePackage.jl` and edit its content (docstring and module name) to reflect the new name
  - in `docs/make.jl` rename all the occurrences of `MyAwesomePackage` to `MyPackage` (including the account/organisation name where to deploy the documentation)
  - update `docs/src/index.md` and `docs/src/anotherPage.md`
- get it in julia. From a Julia prompt type `] [ENTER]` to enter the `pkg` prompt and then `add git@github.com:MyUser/MyPackage.jl.git`
- declare you want to develop it. Still from the `pkg` prompt, type; `dev MyPackage`. Your new package will be in `[JULIA_ROOT]/dev/MyPackage`.
